Prerequisites

    - Ansible 2.9 or later installed on your control node
    - SSH access to the target Linux hosts
    - Sudo package installed on the target hosts


Usage

1 Clone the repository to your local machine:

     git clone https://github.com/your_username/ansible-cve-2021-3156.git



2 Update the inventory file hosts.ini with the hostnames or IP addresses of your target Linux hosts.
3 Run the Ansible playbook:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini check-cve.yml

This will check for the CVE-2021-3156 vulnerability on all hosts defined in hosts.ini and save the results to a text file at /var/log/cve_report.txt on each host.

4 (Optional) To view the results on the command line, run the playbook with the --tags display option:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini check-cve.yml --tags display

This will display the vulnerability status of each host in the playbook output.

Customization

You can customize the playbook to meet your specific requirements. Here are some examples:

-    To check for the vulnerability on hosts running a different Linux distribution, modify the package manager and command used in the playbook.
-    To save the results to a different file or location, modify the dest parameter in the copy module.
-    To modify the format or content of the report, modify the Jinja2 template used in the copy module.

Troubleshooting

-    If the playbook fails with an error related to SSH or sudo, ensure that you have the correct SSH credentials and that the become parameter is set to true in the playbook.
-    If the playbook fails to find the Sudo package, ensure that the package is installed on the target hosts and that the package manager used in the playbook is correct for your Linux distribution.
-    If the playbook fails to write the report file, ensure that the destination directory exists and that the user running the playbook has write permissions to the directory.
